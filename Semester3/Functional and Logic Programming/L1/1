; 1.
; a) Write a function to return the n-th element of a list, or NIL if such an element does not exist.
; b) Write a function to check whether an atom E is a member of a list which is not necessarily linear.
; c) Write a function to determine the list of all sublists of a given list, on any level.
;  A sublist is either the list itself, or any element that is a list, at any level. Example:
;  (1 2 (3 (4 5) (6 7)) 8 (9 10)) => 5 sublists :
;  ( (1 2 (3 (4 5) (6 7)) 8 (9 10)) (3 (4 5) (6 7)) (4 5) (6 7) (9 10) )
; d) Write a function to transform a linear list into a set.
