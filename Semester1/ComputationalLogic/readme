Iteration 1
Running scenario

First run of application:
 

⦁	Add two numbers in base b:
⦁	Both numbers are positive:  

⦁	Both numbers are negative: 

⦁	First number is positive and second number is negative:  

⦁	First number is negative and second number is positive:  

⦁	Substract two numbers in base b:
⦁	Both numbers are positive:  





⦁	Both numbers are negative:  

⦁	First number is positive and second number is negative:  

⦁	First number is negative and second number is positive:  







⦁	Multiplication of a number with another one digit number in base b:
⦁	Both numbers are positive:  

⦁	Both numbers are negative:
 

⦁	One number is positive and the other number is negative:  






⦁	Division of a number with another one digit number in base b:
⦁	Both numbers are positive:  

⦁	Both numbers are negative:  


⦁	One number is positive and the other number is negative:  




Conversion of a number from a base b into a base h:
⦁	Base b < h and we use substitution method as follows:  
⦁	Base b > h and we use successive divisions and multiplications method as follows:  

⦁	Base b, h are from the following list {2, 4, 8, 16} and we can also use rapid conversions:
